What has straw in common with wheat [for nourishment]?” says the Lord . <strong class="text-info">“Is not My word like fire [that consumes all that cannot endure the test]?” says the Lord , “and like a hammer that breaks the [most stubborn] rock [in pieces]?"</strong>

    <p2 class="matcom2">...Men's fancies are light, and vain, and worthless, as the chaff which the wind drives away. But the word of God has substance in it; it is of value, is food for the soul, the bread of life. Wheat was the staple commodity of Canaan, that valley of vision, Deut. 8:8; Ezek. 27:17. There is as much difference between the vain fancies of men and the pure word of God as between the chaff and the wheat. </br>It follows (v. 29), Is not my word like a fire, saith the Lord? Is their word so? Has it the power and efficacy that the word of God has? No; nothing like it; there is no more comparison than between painted fire and real fire. Theirs is like an ignis fatuus –a deceiving meteor, leading men into by-paths and dangerous precipices. Note, The word of God is like fire. The law was a fiery law (Deut. 33:2), and of the gospel Christ says, I have come to send fire on the earth, Luke 12:49. Fire has different effects, according as the matter is on which it works; it hardens clay, but softens wax; it consumes the dross, but purifies the gold. So the word of God is to some a savour of life unto life, to others of death unto death. God appeals here to the consciences of those to whom the word was sent: "Is not my word like fire? Has it not been so to you? Zech. 1:6. Speak as you have found." It is compared likewise to a hammer breaking the rock in pieces. </br>The unhumbled heart of man is like a rock; if it will not be melted by the word of God as the fire, it will be broken to pieces by it as the hammer. Whatever opposition is given to the word, it will be borne down and broken to pieces...</p2>
